            <h3>Name: Joker <small>(Heath Ledger)</small></h3>
            <p>The Joker possesses no superhuman abilities, instead using his expertise in chemical engineering to
                develop
                poisonous or lethal concoctions and thematic weaponry, including razor-tipped playing cards, deadly joy
                buzzers,
                and acid-spraying lapel flowers. Back in 2009, during a Comic-Con interview, comic creator Jerry
                Robinson revealed the story behind the Joker's inspiration. While the Joker himself is a sadistic
                maniac, the inspiration for his look was a sympathetic victim of abuse from Victor Hugo's novel, The Man
                Who Laughs.</p>

            <p>Doctor Strange serves as the Sorcerer Supreme, the primary protector of Earth against magical and
                mystical threats. Inspired by stories of black magic and Chandu the Magician, Strange was created during
                the Silver Age of Comic Books to bring a different kind of character and themes of mysticism to Marvel
                Comics.Strange is fueled by “arrogance, ambition, [and] stubbornness.” Sure, he's in the business of
                saving lives, but sometimes, it seems like he only cares about his own.</p>
